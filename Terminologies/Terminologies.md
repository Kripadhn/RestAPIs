Each type of REST API uses different terminologies and techniques to perform operations on resources. Here are some of the commonly used terminologies for each type of REST API:
1. Read Only API: The commonly used terminologies in Read Only APIs are GET, URI, and response codes (200, 404, etc.).
2. CRUD API: The commonly used terminologies in CRUD APIs are POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, URI, request/response body, and response codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, etc.).
3. Partial Updates API: The commonly used terminologies in Partial Updates APIs are PATCH, URI, request/response body, and response codes (200, 204, 400, 404, etc.).
4. Custom API: The terminologies used in Custom APIs can vary based on the requirements of the application, but some commonly used terminologies include POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, URI, request/response body, and response codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, etc.).
5. RESTful API: The commonly used terminologies in RESTful APIs are HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URI, request/response body, media type, and response codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, etc.).
6. RESTful Web Services API: The commonly used terminologies in RESTful Web Services APIs are HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URI, request/response body, media type, XML or JSON data format, and response codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, etc.).
7. Hypermedia API: The commonly used terminologies in Hypermedia APIs are HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URI, request/response body, media type, hypermedia links, and response codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, etc.).
8. Stateless API: The commonly used terminologies in Stateless APIs are HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URI, request/response body, media type, and response codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, etc.).
In addition to the above mentioned terminologies, some other commonly used terminologies in REST APIs include:
• Resource: An entity that can be manipulated using the REST API, such as a user, an article, or a customer.
• Endpoint: A specific URL that represents a resource and can be used to interact with it.
• Request: An HTTP request made to a REST API, which can include information such as the HTTP method, headers, and a request body.
• Response: An HTTP response returned by a REST API, which can include information such as response headers, response body, and a response code.
• Response code: A 3-digit HTTP status code returned in a response, which indicates the result of the request, such as 200 for success or 404 for not found.
• Media type: The format in which the data is represented in a response, such as JSON or XML.
• Query parameter: An optional parameter added to the URL, used to filter or sort resources.
• Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a client,
which can be achieved using various methods such as OAuth, JWT, Basic Authentication, etc.
• Authorization: The process of determining if a client has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource or perform a specific action.
• Rate limiting: The process of limiting the number of requests that can be made by a client in a specific time frame, in order to prevent abuse and protect the API from overloading.
• Caching: The process of storing frequently accessed data in a cache, in order to reduce the response time and the load on the server.
These terminologies play an important role in the implementation of REST APIs and understanding their behavior. Understanding these terminologies can help developers in designing and building REST APIs that are scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain.
