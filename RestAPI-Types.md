There are mainly four types of REST APIs:
1. Read Only API: This type of API returns only data and doesn't allow updates or deletions.
2. CRUD API: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This type of API performs all the database operations including reading, updating, deleting and creating data.
3. Partial Updates API: This type of API allows partial updates to the resources and is used when you only want to update some specific fields of the resource.
4. Custom API: This type of API is designed for specific use cases and is built as per the requirement of the application. These APIs are not standard and can be different for each application.
5. RESTful API: RESTful APIs follow the REST architectural style and use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. These APIs return data in the form of JSON or XML and can be consumed by different clients.
6. RESTful Web Services API: These are the APIs that are built on top of the web services and can be accessed by different clients over the network using standard web protocols such as HTTP.
7. Hypermedia API: This type of API includes information about the next available actions in the response along with the data. These APIs are self-descriptive and help in reducing the coupling between the client and server.
8. Stateless API: These APIs do not store the state of the client and each request is treated as an independent request. This type of API is easy to scale and can be implemented in a distributed environment.
